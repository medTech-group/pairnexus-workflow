# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

First version, from the pair-drop weekend run of 9–12 Oct 2026 and two independent reviews of its proposal.

- **The flow** (`docs/flow.md`): plan (optional maps), spec, build tickets with areas, building, the merge rule, unattended runs.
- **The run charter** (`docs/charter.md`, `workflow charter`): the kick-off questions, the one "go", amendments by the owner's comments, the `workflow:stop` kill switch.
- **The conductor** (`skills/conductor`):
  - pre-flight, check-ins and safe stopping;
  - retries, then `needs-human`;
  - lanes by `Area:`, conductor-ops and the ledger, release under a grant, and the final report.
- **build-ticket** and **review-panel**: rounds until clean, with a Correctness pass for any commit after the last round; the findings table; local evidence for the merge rule.
- **The CLI** (`scripts/workflow.py`):
  - readiness (blockers closed as completed, claims by label, owner tasks);
  - the state block with its size limit;
  - briefings rendered with required slots (a briefing with a gap is refused);
  - sharded, resumable evidence by head SHA, compared with the base branch's test count;
  - vendoring with a lockfile (local edits kept, one mode per project).
- **The hooks:**
  - the guard: base-branch pushes, force-pushes, deploys, protected paths, new skip markers and sensitive posts, across Bash, Edit/Write and GitHub's MCP tools;
  - the checklist gate (`WORKFLOW-STATUS`, at most two blocks, never while already continuing);
  - flow context;
  - environment repair.
- **Enforcement** (`docs/enforcement.md`): the ruleset, the credential-free ticket environment and CODEOWNERS come first; the hooks are defence in depth.
